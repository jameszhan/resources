This is a bochs test packet for linux 0.1x system.

When you, just make a sub directory 'linux-0.1x' in the bochs main directory
and copy the text file 'bochsrc.txt' to the bochs main directory.

Note: Before copy, backup your own bochsrc.txt file.

Note2: This system was easy to run into PANIC. Use at your own risk!
