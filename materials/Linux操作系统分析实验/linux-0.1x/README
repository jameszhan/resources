Now, this is a very basic root file system for linux 0.1x.
I wll add more things to this release soon.

This release can only do little things. you can test vi, ls,
mkdir etc. Just for testing with kernel source code.

NOTE:
When using, please change your machince clock back to 19xx.
Because the kernel don't support 2k time.

The system will panic unpredicatablly. Use at your own risk!
