Now, this is a very basic root file system for linux 0.1x.
I wll add more things to this release soon.

This release can only do little things. you can test vi, ls,
mkdir etc. Just for testing with kernel source code.

NOTE:
When testing floppy root (as running bochsrc-fd), when showing
the message of " Insert root floppy and press ENTER", JUST 
press the Enter key. I have already attached the root floppy 
to the 'B:' diskette driver.

The system will panic unpredicatablly. Use at your own risk!

Changelog:
2004.3.4
	This is truelly kernel 0.11 driving system!!
	In order to run bash 1.12.1, I inserted several system
	call stubs. To show  the file date correctly, I added
	one line to the kernel/mktime.c at the top of file.
	For details, see the linux-0.11.dif file.
	
	Add Input/Output tools, such as mtools dealing with DOS
	diskettes, mount/umount command, compress, df, awk...
